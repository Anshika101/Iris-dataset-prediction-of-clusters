# Iris-dataset-predict-the-optimum-number-of-clusters 

Given the Iris dataset predicting the optimum number of clusters and representing it visually.

Steps to follow-

Load and preprocess the iris dataset: Load the iris dataset and represent it visually. We use K means clustering algorithm. K-means is an unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm used for clustering data points into 'k' distinct clusters based on their similarities.  

Determine the optimum number of clusters: Use methods like the Elbow Method to find the best value of 'k' , which indicates the number of clusters.

Apply K-means clustering: Once the optimum 'k' is determined, apply the K-means algorithm to the dataset to cluster the data points.

Visualize the clusters: For 2D data, we can plot the data points with different colors corresponding tho their assigned clusters.
